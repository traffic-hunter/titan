# Titan

Titan is a message dispatcher with automatic routing capabilities.

## What is message dispatcher?

A Message Dispatcher is a component that routes incoming messages to appropriate handlers or processors based on message type, content, or predefined rules.

## Concept

- High performance and low latency (NIO, Async)
- Auto routing with service discovery
- We periodically monitor heap usage via JMX to prevent heap overflow.
